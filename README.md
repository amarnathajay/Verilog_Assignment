# Verilog_Assignment

Create a library of parameterized datapath components and use synthesis results from that library to estimate the critical path for various circuits specified using a behavioral netlist. Finally, compare the estimated critical path to actual critical path by implement the circuits using Verilog and and synthesizing the circuit.
